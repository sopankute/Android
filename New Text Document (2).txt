########  AIDL  ########
	
	HAL using AIDL to communicate between framework components such as thosein system.img and hardware components such as those in vendor.img, must use stable AIDL.
	
$$ What is AIDL ?
	- AIDL is used to communicate from Framwork layer to lower HAL. However, we are free to use HIDL or AIDL to communicate from one HAL to another.
	- AIDL can be used between any process in Android: between platform components or between apps.

Where is it located?
	- between Applications and Application Framework
	
$$ AIDL vs HIDL ?
	AIDL is for IPC within Android Framework. HIDL is for IPC between HAL and Android Framework.

$$ why AIDL over HIDL?
	AIDL has stability support
	AIDL also has a better versioning system than HIDL.
	it is single IPC lang
